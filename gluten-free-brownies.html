        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160 C (320 F). Grease and line an 8 inch square baking tin with baking or parchment paper, ensuring two sides overhang.
       <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the melted butter and sugars and gently whisk together. Add the vanilla extract and stir.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring in-between, then sift in the cocoa powder and flour. Stir until just combined. Add chocolate chips.
       <li>Pour the brownie batter in the prepared tin and place in the oven.</li>
          <li>Bake brownies for approximately 30-35 minutes or until they no longer wobble in the middle.</li>
          <li>Leave in tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
          <li>These brownies are quite fragile so if you can, transfer to the fridge for an hour before cutting into squares to serve.</li>
                </ol>
