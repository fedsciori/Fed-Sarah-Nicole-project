        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Grease a square baking tin (roughly 20cm) with a little oil, then line with greaseproof paper.</li>
       <li>Place a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the base doesn’t touch the water. Break 150g of chocolate into the <br>bowl and allow it to melt, then set aside to cool slightly.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, sieve the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and a pinch of salt. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways,<br> scrape out the seeds, then add them to the bowl. Stir in the oil, soya milk and melted chocolate until combined.</li>
       <li>Roughly chop and stir in the remaining chocolate and most of the pecans, reserving a few for the top. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin,<br> spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle over the remaining pecans, then place into the hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes, <br>or until cooked on the outside, but still gooey in the middle.</li>
         <li>Leave to cool for around 5 minutes, turn out onto a wire cooling rack, then serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you’re feeling <br>extra indulgent.</li>
                    </ol>
